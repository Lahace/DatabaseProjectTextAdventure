# Database Course Project, Textual Adventure

This project was an assignment for the Database course, which is part of the the Information technology engineering degree in University of Padua.

I don't really know if this is working nor if this is complete since i uploaded the first backup i found.

I uploaded this for backup/learning purposes for anyone intrested.

## HOW TO

In order to make this project work, first you need to execute the various SQL files inside the SQL/ directory
Then you need to set connection variables inside DB.java:
```
private static String user = null;
private static String password = null;
private static String DBName = null;
private static String location = null;
```
The connection section is quite a mess, it was mate like that in order to ease the frequent switches from local to university database or vice-versa.
This should be all.
Enjoy!
